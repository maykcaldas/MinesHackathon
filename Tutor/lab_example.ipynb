      "The student's answer does not align with the rubric. The student is not using the correct volumes of acetonitrile and water, and they are not using a calibrated pH probe to monitor the pH changes. They are also not sonication the mobile phase to remove any bubbles. \n",

      "Final Answer: Your procedure for preparing the mobile phase needs some corrections. First, you should be using 600 mL of HPLC grade acetonitrile, not 100 mL of 99.9% acetonitrile. Second, you should be diluting this in a 1L volumetric flask, not a 2L flask. Third, you should be using a calibrated pH probe to monitor the pH changes as you add sulfuric acid dropwise, not just adding sulfuric acid until the pH is 2.6. Finally, you should be sonicating the mobile phase for about 5 minutes to remove any bubbles, not allowing the solution to settle and pouring off the top phase. The sediment is not the mobile phase. Please revise your procedure accordingly."
